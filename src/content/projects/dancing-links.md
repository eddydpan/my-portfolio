## GitHub Repository
This repo contains the source code and website for the Dancing Links algorithm visualizer.  

**GitHub Link:** [https://github.com/eddydpan/dancing-links](https://github.com/eddydpan/dancing-links)

## Overview

For my Data Structures and Algorithms final project, I did a deep dive on the 'Dancing Links' algorithm by Dr. Don Knuth, the author of the renowned *The Art of Computer Programming* series. During my search, I watched his [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cR9zDlvP88). Something caught my ear at [this timestamp](https://youtu.be/_cR9zDlvP88?si=9DJrhUNgDw6jaA7j&t=1777): Knuth states  

    "I'm still waiting on somebody to write an app that takes this algorithm and an exact cover 
    problem, and somehow animates it... I wish I had a good visualization of the process."   

Since this lecture was recorded back in 2018, I imagined someone would've already taken up the esteemed professor's call-to-action. I began scouring the internet for any form of dynamic visualizer for the Dancing Links, yet nothing came up after pages of Google and repositories on GitHub. I was elated to find the perfect project to work on.  

I first implemented the algorithm in my most comfortable language, Python, to dig a bit deeper into each step. After, I ported the algorithm into JavaScript, then began building the visualizer as a client-side React application. I faced implementation challenges due to the complex nature of which nodes to display during the process of covering and uncovering. 

## Next Steps 
I finished my beta release by the end of the two-week project period: it features the logic for creating an Exact Cover Problem and stepping through a visualization of the Dancing Links algorithm. I am planning on returning to it now that I have more React and JavaScript experience under my belt to bring it to deployment-ready. I'm hoping to reach Knuth once I have finished this project; although, it has proven more difficult than I expected to reach him as he notes on his personal website that the only emails he'll look at are ones that point out bugs in his books.

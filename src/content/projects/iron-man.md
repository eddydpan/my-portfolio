Over the course of half a semester, my friends and I built this mockup of the Iron Man Mark-5 helmet. We wanted it to have all the features the helmet has from the movies--especially the AI voice assistant, AR Heads-Up Display (HUD), and mask actuation. After many sleepless nights, three prototype iterations, and a rollercoaster of emotions, I present to you our take on the MK5 Helmet.

## Features

Real-time motion tracking, voice-controlled commands, and an integrated heads-up display (HUD) for enhanced situational awareness.

## Technologies Used

Python, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Serial, 

## Next Steps

The next iteration will include advanced exoskeleton support and integration with AR/VR technologies.

Over the course of half a semester my Sophomore Fall, my friends and I built this mockup of the Iron Man Mark-5 helmet. We wanted it to have all the features the helmet has from the movies--especially the AI voice assistant, AR Heads-Up Display (HUD), and mask actuation. After many sleepless nights, three prototype iterations, and a rollercoaster of emotions, I present to you our take on the MK5 Helmet.
